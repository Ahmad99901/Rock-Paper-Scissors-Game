#Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is my first ever program designed for a player to face against a computer.  The User enters
1-3 which corresponds to each element, 1-Rock, 2-Paper, 3-Scissors.  When the player chooses a number,
the computer randomly generates a number using the import random library and randint function.  To
ensure player does not give a number less than or higher than 3 or any decimals, the system will 
print an invalid input if player does so.
